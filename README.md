## A bit about me

#### ‚úÖ I am confident in
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org)
[![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
[![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[![JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

#### ‚úçÔ∏è I am learning
[![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-777BB4?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white)](https://www.php.net)
[![Svelte](https://img.shields.io/badge/svelte-%23f1413d.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=svelte&logoColor=white)](https://svelte.dev/)
[![Laravel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Laravel-FF2D20?style=for-the-badge&logo=laravel&logoColor=white)](https://laravel.com/)
#### üìö I want to learn

[![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
[![SASS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sass-CC6699?style=for-the-badge&logo=sass&logoColor=white)](https://sass-lang.com/)

If this seems like a lot of languages or a strange combination, it's because it is! A lot of these I know from either being forced to during school, taking on old projects, doing random work, testing, or my past self.

#### üîß Tools and Services
[![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-316192?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)](https://www.postgresql.org) 
[![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-%23FF9900.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white)](https://aws.amazon.com/)
[![Stripe](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stripe-626CD9?style=for-the-badge&logo=Stripe&logoColor=white)](https://www.stripe.com)
[![Twilio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Twilio-F22F46?style=for-the-badge&logo=Twilio&logoColor=white)](https://www.twilio.com)<br />(100% the best<br /> relational database, <br />prove me wrong)

Other than that, there's not much else about me. I'm working on a portfolio site which should be up sooner or later.
